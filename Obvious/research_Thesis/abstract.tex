Recently there has been outbreaks of Zika virus which have lead to epidemics. Not much work has been done over the years to model the spread of this infection.
Since its emergence Zika virus has been modelled with traditional compartmental models, where the population is assumed to be well mixed.
We study a different approach based on small world networks. We build a Zika virus model on a small world network, to describe the behaviour and course of Zika virus.


Small world networks, introduced by Strogatz and Watts,
assume that one is more likely to spread the disease to someone in their family, someone who lives near them, or someone they know.

The small world
model of infectious disease combines this sort of clustering in the graph with  modelling the spread of disease as a dynamical system.
