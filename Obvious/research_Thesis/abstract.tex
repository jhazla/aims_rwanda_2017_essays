Recently there has been outbreaks of Zika virus which has
\Jnote{s/has/have}
lead to epidemics. Not much work has been
\Jnote{done}
over the years to model the spread of the
\Jnote{s/the/this}
infection.
Since its emergence Zika virus has been modelled with traditional compartmental models,where
\Jnote{Space after comma}
the population is assumed to be well mixed.
We study a different approach based on small world networks.We
\Jnote{Space after period.}
build a Zika virus model on a small world network, to describe the behaviour and course of Zika virus.


Small world networks, introduced by Strogatz and Watts, on the other hand
\Jnote{Delete ``on the other hand''.}
assume that one is more likely to spread the disease to someone in their family, someone who lives near them, or someone they know.

The Smallworld
\Jnote{s/Smallworld/small world}
model of infectious disease combines this sort of clustering in the graph with a probability
\Jnote{s/a probability to model/modelling}
to model the spread of disease as a dynamical system.
