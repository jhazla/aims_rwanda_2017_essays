The laws of nature at a microscopic level are described by quantum mechanics. Due to the superposition and non-locality in quantum mechanics our notion of reality has changed. Furthermore, theoretical  as well as experimental evidence imply an impossibility of reproducing the quantum predictions  by any theory with local physical variables.

In this essay, we explore quantum non-locality from different aspects. First, we show that quantum non-locality can give better strategy for some kinds  of two-prover game such as famous $CHSH$ game. Secondly, we construct a game similar to  $CHSH$ (with slightly different rules) and we show that this game  does not give quantum advantage.

We also present that quantum mechanics cannot obey local realism in form of hidden variables using a method introduced by \citet*{Jevtic:2015:10.1364/JOSAB.32.000A50}. We also prove a conjecture given by Jevtic and Rudolph, which says that for any maximally entangled state of two qubits, when a subsystem is steered to three ensembles of orthogonal bases, then the quantum prediction obey  local hidden description if and only if the angles between those ensembles lie in convex hull of special set of points.



%A short, abstracted description of your essay goes here. 
%It should be about 100 words long. But write it last.
%
%An abstract is not a summary of your essay: it's an abstraction of that. 
%It tells the readers why they should be interested in your essay but summarises all
%they need to know if they read no further.
%
%The writing style used in an abstract is like the style used in the rest of your essay: concise, clear and direct. 
%In the rest of the essay, however, you will introduce and use technical terms. In the abstract you should
%avoid them in order to make the result comprehensible to all.
%
%You may like to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue.

% At a unviersity like Stellenbosch you *must* produce an abstract in Afrikaans for your masters.
% At AIMS you are encouraged to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue
% French, Igbo, Mlagasy, etc. just write it using LaTeX's special
% characters.
% Arabic students see the arabic.tex file for an example
% Amharic use openoffice and export from there and import a figure here.
% Where the words do not exist put the English work in italics, or use mathematical symbols.
