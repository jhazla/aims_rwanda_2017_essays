 
 Bib files are VERY PICKY about syntax, more so than python
 Don't mix your Ps and Qs or commas and brackets.
 
 Check your line endings end in a comma,

 Always separate AUTHORs by "and"
 AUTHOR1 and AUTHOR2 and AUTHOR3 and AUTHOR4 and ..... and AUTHORX
 where AUTHORX is   Lastname, Firstname   or   Firstname Lastname
 Put ALL the authors, not et al. 

 When you get arbitrary downloads ALWAYS check the copyright, and ask or inform
 the institution/author if this is required. Citing is not enough, some
 material may not be used. 

 For web published items, because they can change, put YEAR = "Accessed in April 2012",
 and if the item has a publish date, put that in the HOWPUBLISHED field after
 the institutions's name, (then publish date, then \url{}).
 Always find the original URL, not some Google Docs upload where you saved it

 Never put %comments in the middle of a bibtex file; they cause problems
 too often.

 Remove the .bbl, .blg, .aux, ,.out files if your bibtex gets stuck 
 on errors (some non-ascii characters can cause this) and rerun in
 a terminal if texmaker does not tell you what the problem is.
