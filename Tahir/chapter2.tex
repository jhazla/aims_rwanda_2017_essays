\begin{defn}[Complex vector space]

% \Jnote{Never use textbf. You should use begin\{defn\} etc.}

A complex vector space, $V$, is a set that is closed under both vector addition
($ +$) and scalar multiplication (.) and satisfying the following properties,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall~ \ket{x},~\ket{y} \in ~ V : ~\ket{x}+\ket{y} ~\in~ V $.
\item $\forall \ket{x},~\ket{y} \in ~ V : \ket{x}+\ket{y}=\ket{y}+\ket{x}$
\item $\forall~ \ket{x},~\ket{y}, ~\ket{z} \in ~ V:\left(\ket{x}+\ket{y}\right)+\ket{z}=\ket{x}+\left(\ket{y}+\ket{z}\right)$
\item $\exists ~\ket{I} \in ~V~ \text{such that }~ \forall~ \ket{x} ~\in V: \ket{x}+\ket{I}=\ket{x}$
\item $\forall ~\ket{x} \in V,~ \exists \ket{b} ~ \text{such that } ~\ket{x}+\ket{b}= \ket{I}$
\item $\forall a~\in ~\mathbb{C}$, $\ket{x}~\in ~V~ :~ a\ket{x}~ \in V$.
\item $\forall ~\ket{x} \in ~V,~ \exists~ k ~\in \mathbb{C} :k\ket{x}=\vec{x}$
\item $\forall ~ a,b \in ~\mathbb{C} ~\text{and} ~ \ket{x}\in V :\left(a.b\right) \ket{x}=a.\left(b \ket{x}\right)$
\item $\forall ~ a \in \mathbb{C} ~\text{and} ~ \ket{x}, \ket{y}\in V:a\left(\ket{x}+\ket{y}\right)=a\ket{x}+a\ket{y}$
\item $\forall ~ a,b \in \mathbb{C} ~\text{and} ~ \ket{x}\in V:\left(a+b\right)\ket{x}=a\ket{x}+b\ket{x}$,
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
where $\ket{I}$ is the natural element of addition and $\ket{b}$ is the inverse of $\ket{x}$.
In addition of that, the scalar multiplication has the following properties in complex vector space $V$.
%The main reason of representing quantum mechanics by complex vector space framework is to remain consistent with the superposition principle.
\begin{defn}[Inner product ]\label{Innerpro}

The inner product of two vectors, $\ket{x} ,\ket{y }\in V$,where $V$ is complex vector space is defined similar to Euclidean inner product except that there is an additional factor which is hermitian conjugate of the vector $\ket{x}$.
$$\left\langle x,y\right\rangle=\bra{x}\ket{y }$$
The result from this operation is a complex number but not necessary real for vector in complex vector space. Although, the inner product of vector with it self.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Norm of vector]

The norm of vector $\ket{x} \in V$ is given by $\| \ket{x}\|=\sqrt{\left(\bra{x}\ket{x}\right)}$.
\end{defn}
%\Jnote{Scalar product is not defined yet.}

\begin{defn}[Orthogonality]

The vectors $\ket{x}, \ket{y} \in V$ are said to be orthogonal if and only if $\bra{x}\ket{y}=0$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Hilbert Space]

A Hilbert space $H$ is a inner product space such that the induced Hilbertian norm.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Pythagoras]

Let $\ket{v_1},\dots \ket{v_n}$ mutually orthogonal vectors, then the following propriety is satisfy.
$$\|\ket{v_1}+\ket{v_2}+\dots+\ket{v_n}\|^2=\|\ket{ v_1}\|^2+\| \ket{v_2}\|^2+\dots +\|\ket{ v_n}\|^2$$
\end{defn}
%\Jnote{Better way to write norm: $\|v\|$ (look at the code).}

\begin{defn}[Cauchy Schwartz Inequality]\label{CSC}

$\ket{x}, \ket{y} \in V $  and $V$ is inner product space,
then $\|\bra{y}\ket{x}\|^2~\leq \|\ket{x} \|^2\|\ket{y}\|^2$
\end{defn}
%\Jnote{Don't use mid (use it only if it is in the middle). Use braket instead
%of separate bra and ket.} 

%Note that the above notation called Dirac notation $\ket{x}$ vector and $\bra{x}$ is dual vector, in this notation the inner product of vector$\ket{x}$ ~ given $\bra{x}\ket{x}$.

\begin{defn}[Hermitian operators]

The matrix operator $A$ is said  to be Hermitian  if and only if $$A=A^\dagger$$
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\label{DIA}\citep*{book:1292540}
For any Hermitian matrix $A$ there exist particular  basis $\{\ket{a_i}\}$, such that in this bases  $A$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
A=\sum_i \lambda_i \ket{a_i}\bra{a_i}.
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_i$ is eigenvalue associated with the bases $a_i$.
\end{prop}
\begin{defn}[Norm of matrix]
For any matrix $A$, then the norm  $A$ given by
\begin{equation}
\| A \|=\max_{v: \| v\|=1}\| A v\|\label{fact}.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}
\section{ Quantum mechanics preliminaries }
\subsection{Quantum postulates}\hfill \break
We now consider the postulates of quantum mechanics, and their significance.The first postulate describes the mathematical structure we use to represent quantum mechanical systems.
\begin{itemize}
\item {Postulate 1}

Any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with in a Hilbert space known to called the state space of the system. The system is completely described by its state vector, $\ket{\Psi}$ , which is a unit vector in the system’s state space~\citep{book:17312}.
\item{Postulate 2}

The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. That is, the state of the system at different time $t_0$ and $t_1$ is related by a unitary operator, $U$, which depends only on the times period of time $t_0$ and $t_1$:
$$\ket{\Psi}=U\ket{\Phi},$$
where $\ket{\Phi}$ is the state at the time $t_0$ and $\ket{\Psi}$ the state at time $t_1$. The continuous time evolution of the state is described by the Schrödinger equation ~\citep*{book:17312}.
\item{Postulate 3}

The measurements of quantum mechanics system is described by a collection $\{M_r \}$ of measurement operators \citep*{book:17312}. These are operators acting on the state space of the system being
measured. The index $r $ refers to the measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is $\ket{\Psi}$ immediately before the measurement then the probability that result $r$ occurs is given as below.
$$Pr[r]=\bra{\Psi}M^{\dagger} M\ket{\Psi}$$ .
The measurement collections ${M_r }$ must the satisfy the following condition.
$$\sum_r M_{r}^{\dagger} M_r=1$$.


\item{Postulate 4}

The composite state of physical system is given by tensor product of the individual state spaces of the component~\citep{book:889079} . Moreover, if we have systems independently prepared in different states $\ket{\Psi_1} \dots \ket{\Psi_n}$, then the joint state of the total system is
$$\ket{\Psi_1}\otimes\dots \otimes\ket{\Psi_n}$$
\end{itemize}
Note that not all kind of composited system can  not be factorizes into it elementary elements,the composed states  such that not possible on such factorization is called entangled state.
\subsection{Entanglement}\hfill \break
Entanglement is one of the most special and surprising phenomena, which has no analogue to it exists in the classical interaction between two particles or more\citep{PhysRevLett.78.5022}. The interacted particle influences by measurement of each another even if they separated, and no longer interacting . This phenomena called spooky action at distance by Einstein in his well known paper~\cite{EPR}.

To demonstrate what the Entangled state, let consider quantum mechanical state that consisting two subsystem. Each subsystem associated to Hilbert space, $H_A$ to subsystem $A$ and $H_B$ to the subsystem $B$ with complete orthogonal basis $\ket{i}_A \text{and} \ket{j}_B$ where $i,j:1,2,\dots$. 
The composed system of those two subsystem would be held on Hilbert space $H_A\otimes H_B$, which snapped by$\ket{i}_A \otimes \ket{j}_B$, the state of any the system $\ket{\varphi}_{AB}$ can be whiten as linear combination of basis states $\ket{i}_A ,\ket{j}_B$
\begin{equation}\label{enta}
\ket{\varphi}_{AB}=\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} \ket{ij}_{AB}
\end{equation}

Where $c_{ij}$ is complex coefficient and the normalization imply $\sum_{ij} c_{ij}=1$, if the state in \ref{enta} can not be written as tensor product of two normalized states ,each state corresponds to one of these subsystems, $A\text{ and} B$, then we called entangled state.

The actual demonstration of entanglement by an experimentally testable form of Bell’s inequality proposed by Michael Horne ,Clauser and Freedman\citep{PhysRevLett.23.880}.The success of CHSH and its attendant experimental demonstrations received wide attention in the physics literature and opened a new way of thinking.

\subsection{Density operators}\label{DMO}\hfill \break
Density operator, also called (density matrix), encodes all accessible information about a quantum mechanical system. It turns out that the ideal description of pure states by state vectors $\ket{\Psi}$ on Hilbert space might not be describe the statistical properties of mixed state.
For any pure state $\ket{\Psi}$ the Density operator $\rho$ given by
\begin{align}
\rho:=\ket{\Psi}\bra{\Psi},
\end{align}
with properties 
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] ~$\rho^2=\rho$ (orthogonal Projection),
\item [2.]~$\rho^\dagger =\rho$  (Hermitian),
\item [3.]~$Tr(\rho)=1$  (Normalization),
\item [4.]~$\rho \geqslant 0$ (Positivity).
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, the mixed state is the state that satisfied all those property except $\rho^2\neq\rho$. this is implies reduced  density matrix of  one particle in  mixted state can be with the following form.
\begin{equation}
\rho_{mix }= \sum_{i} p_i \ket{\Psi_i}\bra{\Psi_i}
\end{equation}
Where $p_i$ is the probability to find the an ensemble system in individual state described by set of orthogonal basis $\ket{\Psi_i} $ ,and $\sum_{i}^n p_i=1$.


\subsection{Quantum bits}\hfill \break
In boolean algebra the bit is assumed to be two distinct values, either $0 $ or $1$, which constitute the building blocks of the classical information theory. Quantum information theory, on the other hand, is based on qubits\citep{nielsen2002quantum}. A unit vector in the complex Hilbert space $C^2$ , whose standard basis vectors are denoted.

\begin{equation}
\ket{0}\text{or}\ket{1}.
\end{equation}
Instead of a simple two state system that can either be in state $0$ or $1$, a qubit is a quantum two level system. The two eigenstate $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$  can be set in any superposition of the form
$$\ket{\Psi}=c_1\ket{0}+c_2\ket{1}$$
where $c_i$ is complex number. Aquibit could also be entangled with another.
