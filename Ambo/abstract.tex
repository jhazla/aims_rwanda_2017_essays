Games are inherent to  human nature and are present in all cultures. This research studies the mathematical game called \say{\emph{prover game}}
\Jnote{s/mathematical game called prover games/class of mathematical games
  called prover games}
by establishing the relationship between parallel repetition of multi-prover games and the Hales-Jewett theorem. The umbilical cord that connects parallel repetition and the Hales-Jewett theorem is the combinatorial line.
\Jnote{Make a second paragraph here.}
In this paper,
\Jnote{s/paper/essay}
four implications are proved between these theorems: Van der Waerden's theorem, Szemer√©di's theorem, Hales-Jewett theorem and the density version of Hales-Jewett theorem. Then,  some notions about a two-prover game
\Jnote{s/a two-prover game/two-prover games}
are  generalized. Eventually, the double implication between parallel repetition and the Hales-Jewett theorem are
\Jnote{s/are/is}
demonstrated.

% At a unviersity like Stellenbosch you *must* produce an abstract in Afrikaans for your masters.
% At AIMS you are encouraged to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue
% French, Igbo, Mlagasy, etc. just write it using LaTeX's special

% Arabic students see the arabic.tex file for an example
% Amharic use openoffice and export from there and import a figure here.
% Where the words do not exist put the English work in italics, or use mathematical symbols.
