% Don't change anything above this.

% Overly long acknowledgements are not professional.


This research could not be achieved without the spiritual and intellectual support of several persons.
%First of all,  I am grateful to the God for his goodness.

First of all, I am highly indebted to African Institute for Mathematical Sciences for  the tremendous  financial support. Without this support,  this research and this master degree would not have been possible.

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Jan H{\k{a}}z{\l}a for his helpful comments, remarks, encouragements and for introducing me to this interesting topic of research. Besides my supervisor, a thank you to all my teachers.

I would like to express my gratitude towards  my darling spouse, my children, my parents and members  of my family for their unfailing support and assistance. My absence was difficult to support. But you have endured. Thank you again.

My thanks and appreciations also go to my classmates for their kind cooperation and friendship. By this, my thanks also to the staff of African Institute for Mathematical Sciences.

Last but not the least, I am also grateful to my friends who have supported me along the way.
