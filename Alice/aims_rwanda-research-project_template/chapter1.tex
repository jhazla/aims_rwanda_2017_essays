One of the most popular way to transmit the information within organization  is  to produce written reports.  Report explains how different activities of the organization are going. For large organizations it is 
%\Jnote{Delete ``so''.}
challenging to go through  each and every report manually.
This research has an aim of providing an easy way of visualizing and extracting important information locked in reports.

International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (IFRC) has some millions of reports related to humanitarian support.

How to know automatically the number of people suffered from a disease? How to know the fraction of fund spent
on shelter?

In this research, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find the solution for the extracting entity.
Big data and Machine learning algorithms analysed the huge data .

Entity can be defined as an instance of existence of something. For example,what is the activity done on what place?  when and how?
% \Jnote{No space before question mark.}

Entity is defined as a single unit of data like location, people, organization and so on. Entities  can be classified based on their relationship.

There are key procedures to be performed for extracting entities: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The sentences which compose a report  must be parsed.
\item Entities must be identified in the report and classified.
\item Relationship between entities must be modelled.
\end{itemize}

A report is composed of paragraphs, each paragraph is made by sentences. Natural  Language Processing techniques deal with sentences and context based analysis. It splits the sentences into tokens
then removing the common words in order to  work with corpus to get entities.

The meaning of a word can depend on its surroundings but it can also be independent of it.

For extracting significant entities, the context of a word is one of the point to be considered carefully.
